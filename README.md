# trufflify

inspired by obamify or obamaify? built in cpp because i love importing libraries and dealing with dependancy and build issues and also love wasting time

## how it works

pretty simple, it just calculates the difference in colour values for "particles" (grouped pixels) between the truffle.png image and the input image you specify.

after doing trufflify.exe -f "input.jpg", you can press enter and the particles move to replicate truffle.png, press enter again to close or just close the window.

you can press 'r' to reset
